            In the face of corona, most companies have entered an economic recession thrust upon them in a matter of minutes, however, Zoom, has quite literally prospered, if not thrived. Over the past 6 month period the company observed an astounding 100% increase in stock price from about 80 dollars per share to 159 dollars per share. But why? Why this company, in this industry, at this time? It starts with the Corona virus and ends with business adaptations. It all started with the first introduction of coronavirus to the United States in early February.
            Zoom basically created and managed an online professional platform for hosting meetings and classes. Until recent times, Zoom, and similar companies like WebX, thrived on the global expansion of companies, connecting the multiple parties and allowing for corporations to communicate. The introduction of Covid-19 to major american economic centers forces those in person businesses to cancel all in person activities. The retail sector has collapsed as people can't buy products at stores anymore. But how do telecom, financial institutions, and other businesses continue work while being so intricately dependent upon interpersonal communication. That's when Zoom comes in. In last minute responses to the Corona outbreak, corporations turned to Zoom to help host company meetings. Purchasing those subscriptions ended up in widespread utilization, from businesses, to school systems, to sunday schools, everyone is starting to use it. In addition to watching that stock it is important to understand its future performance. Buy at rock bottom, sell at peak. The peak passed during April when the majority of enterprises were shifted to Zoom generating an enormous influx of cash. However, currently the company was just hit with a major issue of general public insecurity where hackers could enter supposedly "encrypted" meeting rooms. Overall, companies who initially purchased Zoom software will slowly leave as other corporations begin to offer similar services for a lower price.
            That's why, when the outbreak Corona occurred and everyone pulled money out of the market due to the lack of confidence and the coming recession, a lot of large investors looked over the potential of Zoom.

            Quarantine is a new reality and the entire retail industry has literally collapsed. So how are people spending their time? Online services, the internet, and home necessities have dominated consumer purchases in the past few weeks. But everyone's got to do something in their spare time- the gyms are closed, malls are shut down, and going to the park risks the spread of corona. Netflix has basically filled a gaping hole in the lives of most Americans. To an average investor, it seems like the perfect investment. But it isn't. Why?
            No enterprise will be perfectly insulated from the recession and corona pandemic, least of all, one dependent on consumer purchasing. Now, as time goes on, consumers will generally lose confidence in the market, lessening their purchases and throwing the economy into recession; basically a catalyzed business contraction. Now as more and more people are purchasing Netflix, the company will be able to generate greater profits; what else will America do while sitting in their homes? To summarize the cycle, however, an initially increasing amount of people will purchase subscriptions to Netflix due to Corona accounting for their sharp increase in stock price around Mid-February. However, this will be the highest value of the security for many months to come.
