Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project was a basic development of a finance site I want to launch in the future. Each html file contains the code block responsible for each corresponding page (index=home, page2=opportunities, page3=sources, page4=contact). Additionally, I linked two style sheets; one css file in order to format title and headers (style.css) and one scss file in order to format paragraph bodies and context text messages (sassStyle.scss). Finally, the site i created exhibits all aspects of the required code and is a a great base to work off of in the future, since I have more ideas for applications after the course.
